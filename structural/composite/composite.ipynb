{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Composite Design Pattern\n","\n","\n","The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is especially useful when dealing with tree structures, such as file systems, where both individual files and directories (which can contain files and other directories) can be treated the same way.\n","\n","## Key Concepts:\n","1. Component: \n","An interface or abstract class that defines the common interface for both individual objects and composites.\n","2. Leaf: \n","Represents the individual objects in the composition. It implements the component interface.\n","3. Composite: \n","Represents a group of leaf objects. It implements the component interface and can have children (both leaf and composite).\n","4. Client: The code that interacts with the components and composites through the component interface."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Drawing Composite Graphic:\n","Drawing a Circle\n","Drawing a Circle\n","Drawing a Rectangle\n"]}],"source":["from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n","\n","# Component\n","class Graphic(ABC):\n","    @abstractmethod\n","    def draw(self):\n","        pass\n","\n","# Leaf\n","class Circle(Graphic):\n","    def draw(self):\n","        print(\"Drawing a Circle\")\n","\n","# Leaf\n","class Rectangle(Graphic):\n","    def draw(self):\n","        print(\"Drawing a Rectangle\")\n","\n","# Composite\n","class CompositeGraphic(Graphic):\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.graphics = []\n","\n","    def add(self, graphic: Graphic):\n","        self.graphics.append(graphic)\n","\n","    def remove(self, graphic: Graphic):\n","        self.graphics.remove(graphic)\n","\n","    def draw(self):\n","        for graphic in self.graphics:\n","            graphic.draw()\n","\n","# Client\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    #  simple graphics\n","    circle1 = Circle()\n","    circle2 = Circle()\n","    rectangle1 = Rectangle()\n","\n","    #   composite graphic\n","    composite_graphic = CompositeGraphic()\n","    composite_graphic.add(circle1)\n","    composite_graphic.add(circle2)\n","    composite_graphic.add(rectangle1)\n","\n","    # Draw \n","    print(\"Drawing Composite Graphic:\")\n","    composite_graphic.draw()\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"myenv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
