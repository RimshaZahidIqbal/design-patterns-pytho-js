    "- It is a data-driven behavioral pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object known as a command. \n",
    "- It encapsulates all the information that is required to act i.e., it wraps the action and its required parameters together in an object. \n",
    "- It is used to separate the object that invokes the operation from the object that operates.\n",
